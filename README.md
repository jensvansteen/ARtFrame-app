# ARtFrame

This app was made as part of a assignment for my study [Digital Design & Development](https://www.howest.be/en/programmes/bachelor/devine).

## Assignment

The museum "Boijmans van Beuningen" in Rotterdam has to close for serval years for renovation works. In team we had to find a solution so that people would still be able to expercience the museum in a digital way.

### Solution

We came up with the idea to spread the art over the streets of Rotterdam in the form of empty frames. If you scanned the frame a living art work would show up in AR. You would also be able to than ask your assistant questions about the art work.

### Team

* __Rico Borghs:__ Concept, UI, UX, Motion

    Rico is really creative person who always comes up with the most awesome and wicked ideas and concepts. He contributed with designing the app and making the really terrific motion videos for the AR part in the app.

* __Nicolas Nuytten:__ Concept, UI, UX, Web Development

    Nicolas is a awesome creative with strong skills in design and web development who contributed all-around. He helped with designing the app and also designed and coded the website to promote the app. Also make sure to definitely check out his portfolio site where the [case](https://nicolasnuytten.github.io/src/work/artframe.html) is been documented.

* __Jens Van Steen:__ Concept, UX, iOS Development

    My main contribution was to develop the iOS application, I also helped with the UX of the app.

## App

The making of the app was a real joy for me because I was able to deepen myself in something I real enjoy 'making iOS Apps'. I used serval technologies I hadn't used before or had seen in the lectures.

__Used technologies__

* ARKit
* Core Data


### View the content in AR

Once you are in scan mode you can try out a frame to scan like the one below.
